# Changelog

All notable changes to dnsdata-go are recorded here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `zone`: P9 Batch 1 — `TLSA` (RFC 6698), `SMIMEA` (RFC 8162), and
  `SSHFP` (RFC 4255) RR handlers ported from dnsdata-js. TLSA and
  SMIMEA share one struct since their wire and presentation formats
  are byte-for-byte identical. Opt-in via the new
  `zone.RegisterHandlers()` entrypoint, which parallels
  `dnssec.RegisterHandlers()` and keeps the package free of `init()`
  side effects (DESIGN.md §4.21). Closes [#6](https://github.com/shigeya/dnsdata-go/issues/6); part of [#5](https://github.com/shigeya/dnsdata-go/issues/5).

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `verifier`: chain descent no longer terminates at the first non-cut
  label, so DNSSEC-signed names that live one or more labels below an
  unsigned intermediate name (typical case: `*.ad.jp`, `*.co.jp`,
  `*.ne.jp`, `*.kyoto.jp`, …) now validate as Secure instead of being
  misreported as Bogus at the closest signed ancestor. The descent
  loop previously `goto`-jumped to the leaf step on the first
  `descendNoCut` outcome, so e.g. `wide.ad.jp.` was leaf-resolved
  against `jp.`'s keys (RRSIG-over-leaf failed against the wrong
  zone). The fix is to `continue` past empty non-terminals and keep
  walking until a real zone cut is reached or `descendantZones` is
  exhausted. ([#1](https://github.com/shigeya/dnsdata-go/issues/1))

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `resolver/{doh,auth}.Resolve` now surface the authority section of
  the response in addition to the answer section. The previous
  implementation intentionally dropped authority records, which silently
  disabled the v0.2.0 NSEC / NSEC3 negative-proof support: a verifier
  built on top of these resolvers could not locate the no-DS proof in
  the parent zone's response, so any unsigned name under an NSEC3-with-
  opt-out zone (e.g. an unsigned `.com` child) was misclassified as
  Bogus rather than Insecure. The additional section is still ignored
  (glue / EDNS OPT are not part of the validated rrset surface).
  Discovered while integrating dnsdata-go into mailsec-probe; verified
  against `google.com` / `amazon.com` (now Insecure) and
  `iana.org` / `cloudflare.com` / `example.com` (still Secure).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-17

Negative-proof support and alias / wildcard chasing. The chain
validator can now classify the full set of RFC 4033 §5 outcomes plus
the secure-negative variants, follow CNAME / DNAME redirections, and
validate wildcard-synthesised positive answers.

### Added

- `dnssec/` — NSEC / NSEC3 negative-proof primitives.
  - `CompareCanonicalNames` / `EqualCanonicalNames` (RFC 4034 §6.1
    canonical name comparator with wrap-around-safe ordering).
  - `NSEC.MatchesName` / `NSEC.CoversName` / `NSEC.ProvesNoData` /
    `NSEC.ProvesNoDS`.
  - `NSEC3.HasOptOut` / `NSEC3.CoversHash` / `NSEC3.ProvesNoData` /
    `NSEC3.ProvesNoDS`, plus `OwnerHashFromName` for decoding the
    leftmost base32hex label of an NSEC3 owner.
- `verifier/` — three new verdict-producing capabilities.
  - **Insecure-delegation classification.** `descendInto` consults
    the parent zone's NSEC / NSEC3 records when DS is absent: a
    valid proof flips the verdict to `Insecure` and records the
    proof source in the new `Result.InsecureReason` field.
    Supported proof shapes are matching NSEC, matching NSEC3, and
    covering NSEC3 with opt-out (RFC 5155 §6).
  - **Leaf NODATA / NXDOMAIN classification.** `Validate` leaf step
    consults NSEC / NSEC3 NODATA proofs (matching NSEC/NSEC3 with
    qtype absent from bitmap) and NXDOMAIN proofs (NSEC covering
    qname + wildcard-non-existence NSEC; or RFC 5155 §8.4
    three-record NSEC3 closest-encloser proof).
  - **CNAME / DNAME chasing.** `Validate` follows up to
    `MaxAliasHops` (10) CNAME or DNAME redirections, restarting the
    chain walk for each new qname. Each hop is captured as an
    `AliasStep` in `Result.Aliases`. Verdict is worst-of across
    hops. Loops are reported as Bogus with reason "alias loop
    detected"; chains longer than `MaxAliasHops` are reported as
    Bogus with reason "alias chain exceeded N hops".
  - **Wildcard-synthesised positive answers.** When a covering
    RRSIG's `Labels` field is fewer than the qname's label count,
    the validator detects wildcard synthesis (RFC 4034 §3.1.3),
    reconstructs the wildcard owner for digest computation, and
    requires a signed NSEC / NSEC3 proof that the next-closer name
    does not exist (RFC 4035 §5.3.4). On success the verdict
    stays Secure and the new `Result.Wildcard` field carries the
    reconstructed wildcard owner, closest encloser, next-closer
    name, and proof source. Missing or invalid non-existence proof
    classifies the answer Bogus.
- `dnssec.LabelCount`, `dnssec.LastNLabels` — RFC 4034 §3.1.3
  helpers used by the wildcard reconstructor (and reusable by
  callers porting the same logic to other RR types).
- `Result.Wildcard *WildcardInfo` field (JSON-omitempty).
- Two new verdicts: `VerdictSecureNoData` (JSON `"secure-nodata"`)
  and `VerdictSecureNXDomain` (JSON `"secure-nxdomain"`). The four
  existing verdict strings are unchanged.
- `Result.InsecureReason`, `Result.NegativeReason`, and
  `Result.Aliases` (all JSON-omitempty).

### Changed

- `Verdict` enum widened from 4 to 6 states (`MUST 2` and `MUST 11`
  in DESIGN.md §4 updated to match). Consumers that only match on
  the original four strings still see them; consumers that want
  fine-grained secure-negative routing can read the new dashed names.
- `Validate` refactored internally into `validateOneHop` +
  `resolveLeaf` + outer alias loop. Public signature unchanged.
  Existing callers see identical behaviour for non-aliased queries.
- `verifier/doc.go` "Out of scope" list now only retains RFC 5011
  trust-anchor rollover and the DNSKEY / DS cache.
- `dnssec.Zone.CreateDigestTarget` reads `rrsig.Labels` to decide
  whether to substitute the wildcard owner for digest header
  construction. Non-wildcard callers are unaffected because the
  reconstruction branch only fires when `Labels` is strictly less
  than the rrset owner's label count.

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

End-to-end DNSSEC chain validation in pure Go, no external DNS
library, crypto from the standard library only. Walks the chain of
trust from a configured (or built-in) root trust anchor down to a
caller-supplied `(qname, qtype)`, returning a four-state verdict and
the raw DS / DNSKEY / RRSIG evidence consumed along the way.

### Added

- `types/` — RR type / class / opcode / rcode / DNSSEC algorithm
  enums and string conversion. Sentinel error types so callers can
  classify unknown values with `errors.Is`.
- `wire/` — DNS wire-format codec.
  - Domain-name encoder (`DomainNameToWire`) with RFC 1035 label /
    name length validation and RFC 4034 §6.2 canonical lower-casing.
  - Compression-pointer-aware name decoder (`ParseDomainName`) with
    cycle detection and a hop cap.
  - `Builder` for incremental wire-format assembly.
  - `ParseMessage` decodes header + question + answer / authority /
    additional sections into `RawMessage` and `RawRR`.
  - `RDataToString` per-type RDATA → presentation decoder for A,
    AAAA, NS, CNAME, PTR, DNAME, MX, TXT, SOA, SRV, CAA, DNSKEY,
    CDNSKEY, DS, CDS, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM. Unknown types
    use the RFC 3597 §5 generic form.
  - `BuildQuery` / `BuildQueryWithID` / `RandomQueryID` shared by
    both transports, producing an EDNS(0) OPT pseudo-RR with the DO
    bit set so responses include DNSSEC RRSIGs.
- `zone/` — zone-file parser, `ResourceRecord`, pluggable
  `RecordHandler` registry consumed by DNSSEC RR types.
- `dnssec/` — DNSSEC RR handlers and chain operations.
  - `DNSKey` — RFC 4034 Appendix B key-tag (incl. RSAMD5 special
    case), public-key materialisation, Sign / Verify across RSA
    PKCS#1 v1.5 (SHA-1 / SHA-256 / SHA-512), ECDSA P-256 / P-384,
    Ed25519.
  - `RRSig` / `DS` / `NSEC` / `NSEC3` / `NSEC3PARAM` with
    presentation parsing, wire encoding, type-bitmap codec
    (RFC 4034 §4.1.2), and RFC 5155 §5 NSEC3 hash.
  - `Zone` wraps `zone.Zone` with parent pointer, SEP set,
    RFC 4034 §6.2 canonical digest-target builder, and
    KSK / ZSK / CSK verification modes.
  - Root trust anchors — built-in KSK-2017 and KSK-2024 (IANA), and
    `RootAnchors` JSON shape shared with dnsdata-js for
    `~/.dnsdata/root-anchors.json` interop.
  - `RegisterHandlers()` opt-in registration (no `init()` side
    effects per DESIGN.md §4.21).
- `resolver/doh/` — RFC 8484 DoH client.
  - `NewClient`, `Query`, `QueryRaw`, `Resolve`. Provider failover
    (Google → Cloudflare → Quad9 by default), custom HTTP client
    injection, configurable User-Agent.
  - `Resolve` parses responses into `[]*zone.ResourceRecord`
    suitable for direct use as a `verifier.Resolver`.
- `resolver/auth/` — UDP / TCP plain-DNS client.
  - `NewClient`, `Query`, `QueryRaw`, `Resolve`. UDP-first with
    transparent TCP fallback on truncation (RFC 1035 §4.2.1),
    multi-server failover, per-server timeout in addition to
    context deadline, transaction-ID validation, configurable
    `Dialer` injection.
  - `Resolve` parses responses into `[]*zone.ResourceRecord` the
    same way DoH does.
  - Callers must supply server addresses explicitly via
    `WithServers`; the package does not read `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- `verifier/` — DNSSEC chain-of-trust walker.
  - `NewVerifier`, `Validate(ctx, qname, qtype)`.
  - Four-state `Verdict` (`secure | insecure | bogus |
    indeterminate`).
  - JSON-marshallable `Result` with chain summary, bogus-at /
    bogus-reason, evidence captured as presentation text.
  - `Resolver` interface + `ResolverFunc` adapter; works with both
    transports without a shim package.
  - Trust anchors caller-supplied, defaulting to the embedded
    IANA root anchors.

### Documentation

- `DESIGN.md` covers package layout, public API, MUST / SHOULD /
  MAY / MUST NOT contract, porting policy, and roadmap.
- `UPSTREAM_FEEDBACK.md` records both UF-NNN deviation fixes for
  dnsdata-js bugs encountered during porting (UF-001 … UF-004) and
  UP-NNN port-back proposals for new functionality shipped here
  (UP-001 verifier, UP-002 message parser + RData decoders, UP-003
  auth resolver).
- `CLAUDE.md` is the operating manual for further work in this
  repository with Claude Code.

### Not yet implemented

These are tracked in `verifier/doc.go` and the relevant UP entries:

- NSEC / NSEC3 negative-proof handling (used to distinguish Insecure
  from Bogus at no-DS delegations).
- CNAME / DNAME chasing.
- RFC 5011 automatic trust-anchor rollover.
- Cross-call DNSKEY / DS cache (SHOULD #13 in DESIGN.md).
- Helper converters to `miekg/dns.RR` (MAY #17).
